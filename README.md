➡ Hello there❗❕ I am currently a sophomore at California State University, Bakersfield. And I specialize in system architecture, and currently hold multiple industry-standard technology certifications geared towards cloud development, infrastructure, and networks.
➡ Towards programming and technology, I enjoy full-stack development, especially on the MERN stack. However, I am also interested and actively learning about automation, data analysis, machine learning, cloud development, infrastructure, and containerization.
